#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

```python
a)  # This is O(1)
    a = 0
    # This loop will run O(n) times
    while (a < n * n * n)
      # a is incremented by n**2 each loop
      # multiplication, addition and assignment is O(1)
      a = a + n * n
    # Total time complexity is O(1 + n + 1) --> O(n)
```


b)


c)
